title: Here we go again

Welcome to my personal collection of technical notes about Linux system
administration.

The contents of *nth loop* grow organically and I do not guarantee any
coherence among them. The goal is to consolidate information that was useful in
the past and might be useful to future me, saving yet another deep dive into
the most obscure corners of the Internet. Format of posts is brief on purpose
giving just the minimum context needed for future reference. Hopefully some
structure will spontaneously emerge along the way.

# About the author

Hi, I'm Alex. I enjoy tinkering with radical computer clusters. From big and
powerful HPC systems (High Performance Computing) to little and efficient
clusters of SBCs (Single Board Computers like the Raspberry Pi).

Since 2019, I am part of the Scientific Compute & Data team of the Vrije
Universiteit Brussel (Belgium) where my main roles are HPC system architect and
research software engineer.
