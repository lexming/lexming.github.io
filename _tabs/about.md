**nth loop** is a personal collection of technical notes about Linux system administration.

The contents grow organically and I do not guarantee any coherence among them. The goal is to consolidate information that was useful in the past and might save me another search and some time once more. Format of posts is brief on purpose giving just the minimum context needed for future reference. Hopefully some structure will spontaneously arise along the way.
